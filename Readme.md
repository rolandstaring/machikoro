About
=====

Machikoro is a board game by Masao Suganuma. All rights remain by the game designer. 
Buying and playing the actual cardgame with your children is recommended.
The game is in Dutch, but you can easily make an english version

For me this was an expirement in learning Object Oriented Python programming. 
This game is an excellent programming excercise.

I recommend reading:

    'Learning Python: Powerful Object Oriented Programming' from Mark Lutz
    'GUI programming with Python' from Alan D Moore

My next project will be to:

    make a version that can be played on a LAN (Local Area Network) with multiple devices.
    make a version that runs on tablet/ipad

Usage
======

You will need Python 3.6 or higher 
You will need to install pyqt5 see for more information. I just did a 'pip install pyqt5' 

    Simply run with 'python mk_gui.py' on the command-line
